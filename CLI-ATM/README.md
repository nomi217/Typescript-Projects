# ATM

This somewhat complex **TypeScript/Node.js** project is a console-based application. When the system starts the user is prompted with a user id and user pin. After entering the details successfully, the ATM functionalities are unlocked. All the user data is generated randomly.

Run the following command to experience a CLI ATM:
```
npx @naumankhalid/cli-atm
```
Or install using:
```
npm i @naumankhalid/cli-atm
```


Happy Coding :slightly_smiling_face:
