# Currency Converter

The TypeScript console app is used to convert currencies: the users enter a certain amount of money in one currency and set the currency they want to check the monetary value of.

Run the following command to experience a CLI Currency Converter:
```
npx @naumankhalid/currency-converter
```
Or install using:
```
npm i @naumankhalid/currency-converter
```

Happy Coding :slightly_smiling_face:
